            While Leaders can learn on the job, the Advanced Management Program is a 
            structured intervention that helps Leaders prepare themselves to manage this
            transition and take on higher-order roles and responsibilities. It accelerates 
            overall leadership skills through developing adjacent skis and competencies to
            lead multiple functional areas & manage teams effectively.
